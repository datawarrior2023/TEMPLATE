# System Architecture Diagram Outline

## Purpose
The System Architecture Diagram outlines the technical structure of the Skee-Ball League Management Application. It maps out the components, interactions, and data flow within the system, ensuring clarity for development and deployment.

---

## 1. Overview of System Components
The system consists of the following primary components:

1. **Frontend**: User-facing interface for all roles (Admin, Captains, Players, and Spectators).
2. **Backend**: Manages business logic, API endpoints, and data processing.
3. **Database**: Stores team data, scores, user roles, and match schedules.
4. **Authentication Service**: Handles secure user login and role-based access.
5. **Hosting/Deployment**: Infrastructure to serve the application to end users.

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### **Frontend**
- **Technology**: React.js (Single Page Application)
- **Responsibilities**:
   - Render UI for different user roles.
   - Communicate with backend APIs for data.
   - Provide responsive design for mobile and desktop.

### **Backend**
- **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Responsibilities**:
   - Process requests from the frontend.
   - Serve API endpoints for score management, team data, and scheduling.
   - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
   - Perform server-side validation of inputs.

### **Database**
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL (Relational Database)
- **Responsibilities**:
   - Store and manage:
     - User data (names, roles, credentials)
     - Team data (rosters, captains)
     - Match schedules
     - Scores and standings
   - Ensure data integrity and backups.

### **Authentication Service**
- **Technology**: JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication.
- **Responsibilities**:
   - Authenticate users securely.
   - Assign and validate user roles (Admin, Captain, Player).

### **Hosting/Deployment**
- **Technology**: Proxmox (Local Environment) / Docker Containers
- **Responsibilities**:
   - Host frontend and backend services.
   - Manage containers for scalable deployment.
   - Provide testing and production environments.

## 3. Data Flow Diagram
The following is the general flow of data between system components:

1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the **Frontend** (React.js).
   - The frontend sends HTTP requests to the **Backend API** (Node.js).

2. **Data Processing**:
   - The backend processes requests, performs validations, and applies business logic.
   - For secure actions (e.g., login), the backend validates user roles via the **Authentication Service**.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - The backend interacts with the **Database** (PostgreSQL) to read/write data (e.g., scores, teams).
   - Data is returned to the backend, which forwards it to the frontend.

4. **Display**:
   - The frontend updates the UI with processed data.
   - Users view leaderboards, schedules, or stats in real time.

## 4. Diagram Components
The following components will be represented in the System Architecture Diagram:

1. **Frontend (React)**: User-facing screens.
2. **Backend (Node.js)**: Handles APIs and business logic.
3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Data storage for app components.
4. **Authentication (JWT)**: Role-based user authentication.
5. **Hosting**: Proxmox servers and Docker containers.
6. **Data Flow**: Arrows representing the flow between components.

---

## 5. Tools for Diagram Creation
The following tools can be used to design the system architecture:
- **Lucidchart**: Ideal for high-level architecture diagrams.
- **Draw.io** (free): Lightweight and easy for creating architecture maps.
- **Figma**: Allows collaborative diagramming.
- **Miro**: Good for brainstorming and visual planning.

---

## 6. Deliverables
1. **High-Level System Architecture Diagram**: Visual representation of all system components.
2. **Data Flow Diagram**: Arrows showing interactions between components.
3. **Deployment Diagram**: Visual showing how the system will be hosted and deployed.
