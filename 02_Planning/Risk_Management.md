# Risk Management Plan

## Purpose
The Risk Management Plan identifies potential risks to the Skee-Ball League Management Application project and outlines strategies to mitigate, monitor, and manage these risks. This ensures the project stays on track and delivers a successful MVP.

---

## 1. Risk Assessment Framework
Risks will be evaluated based on:
1. **Impact**: The severity of the risk if it occurs (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
2. **Likelihood**: The probability of the risk occurring (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
3. **Priority**: Combination of impact and likelihood to prioritize focus.

## 2. Identified Risks

| **ID** | **Risk**                              | **Impact** | **Likelihood** | **Priority** | **Mitigation Strategy**                                   | **Owner**         |
|--------|---------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1      | Limited development time              | High      | High           | Critical     | Focus on MVP features, regularly review progress.       | James Lee         |
| 2      | Unclear or changing requirements      | Medium    | Medium         | High         | Conduct thorough requirement gathering and approvals.   | Emily Hart        |
| 3      | Delays in backend/frontend integration| High      | Medium         | High         | Plan early integration testing and collaboration.       | Mike Ramirez      |
| 4      | Insufficient testing time             | High      | Medium         | High         | Prioritize critical functionality for testing.          | Chloe Nguyen      |
| 5      | Stakeholder feedback delays           | Medium    | Medium         | Medium       | Schedule feedback windows and follow up regularly.      | James Lee         |
| 6      | Limited UI/UX clarity from stakeholders| Medium   | Medium         | Medium       | Share wireframes early for feedback to reduce ambiguity.| Sarah Cohen       |
| 7      | Scope creep (adding extra features)   | High      | Medium         | High         | Maintain clear scope boundaries; document all changes.  | James Lee         |
| 8      | Resource availability                 | Medium    | Low            | Medium       | Plan realistic timelines; buffer time for key tasks.    | James Lee         |
| 9      | Data loss during development          | Critical  | Low            | High         | Implement version control and regular data backups.     | Mike Ramirez      |

## 3. Monitoring and Reporting
- **Risk Owner**: Each risk has a designated owner responsible for monitoring and mitigation.
- **Weekly Check-Ins**: Risks will be reviewed during weekly project updates.
- **Risk Log**: Maintain a risk log to track risks, their status, and mitigation actions.

| **Risk ID** | **Current Status** | **Mitigation Actions Taken** | **Date Reviewed** |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|
| 1           | Active            | Prioritized MVP features     | [Insert Date]   |
| 2           | Pending Review    | Scheduled follow-up          | [Insert Date]   |

---

## 4. Contingency Plan
For risks deemed **Critical** (e.g., time delays or data loss), the following contingency measures will apply:
1. **Time Delays**: Re-scope features to focus on core MVP requirements.
2. **Data Loss**: Rollback to a prior version using version control backups.
3. **Requirement Changes**: Freeze requirements at key project milestones.
4. **Integration Issues**: Implement a daily code review process during integration.

---

## 5. Tools for Risk Management
- **Project Management Tool**: Notion or Trello to track risks and progress.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for managing backups and code changes.
- **Communication**: Weekly status meetings and Slack updates.

## AI Agent Prompt for Next Steps
**Prompt**:
"I have created a Risk Management Plan for the Skee-Ball League Management Application. It includes identified risks, mitigation strategies, priorities, and monitoring processes. Below is the full content:

<Insert Risk Management Plan Here>

Using this document, please:
1. Review the identified risks and confirm if additional risks should be considered.
2. Highlight any gaps or missing mitigation strategies that could impact project success.
3. Provide guidance for implementing the risk monitoring process and tools, assuming I am learning and need clear, actionable steps."
