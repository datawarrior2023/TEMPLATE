## 4. Development Process Steps
The following steps summarize the development process for each feature:

1. **Define**: Outline the feature based on user stories and priorities.
2. **Design**: Create wireframes and finalize UI/UX designs.
3. **Develop**:
   - Build backend APIs for functionality.
   - Develop frontend UI components.
   - Integrate frontend with backend.
4. **Test**: Execute test cases for functionality, bugs, and performance.
5. **Deploy**: Release the feature in a staging environment.
6. **Validate**: Collect user feedback and make final adjustments.

## 5. Feedback and Iteration Process
1. Collect feedback using structured forms (e.g., Feedback_Form.md).
2. Analyze feedback for recurring issues or suggestions.
3. Prioritize updates and improvements based on impact.
4. Implement updates iteratively.

---

## 6. Process Review
The process will be reviewed at the end of each phase to:
