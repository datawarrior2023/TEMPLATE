## Detailed Activities

### 1. **Initial Questions to Build a Plan**
We started with the following 5 questions to establish a high-level plan:
1. **What are the key features needed for the application?**
2. **Who will use the application, and what are their roles?**
3. **What current processes does the app replace or improve?**
4. **What platforms and tools will be used to build and host the app?**
5. **What is the timeline and priority for delivering the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?**

These questions helped clarify:
- The scope of the application.
- Who the stakeholders are (Admin, Captains, Players, Spectators).
- The need for score input, leaderboard, scheduling, and team management features.

### 2. **Established Workflow and Document Templates**
We outlined the application workflow with **7 phases**:
1. **Requirements Gathering**
2. **Planning**
3. **Design**
4. **Development**
5. **Testing**
6. **Deployment**
7. **Feedback and Iteration**

For each phase, we identified essential templates and documents:
- **Requirements**: BRD, User Stories, Feature Prioritization Matrix.
- **Planning**: Project Plan, Task Timeline, Risk Management.
- **Design**: Wireframes, User Flow Diagrams, Architecture Diagram.
- **Development**: Feature Development Checklist, Backend/Frontend Logs.
- **Testing**: Test Cases, Bug Tracking Log, Testing Checklist, Testing Report.
- **Deployment**: Deployment Checklist, Feedback Form, Post-Deployment Log.
- **Documentation**: Business Overview, Process Documentation, AI Notes.

---

### 3. **Defined Team Roles and Responsibilities**
We created a simulated project team to guide the user through the development process. Each role includes:
- **Name**: Simulated team member.
- **Background**: Experience and skills.
- **Responsibilities**: Role-specific tasks.
- **Deliverables**: Documents or outputs they manage.

Example:
| **Role**               | **Name**           | **Responsibilities**                      |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Project Manager**    | James Lee          | Oversee timelines, risks, and progress.  |
| **UX/UI Designer**     | Sarah Cohen        | Create wireframes, user flows, and UI/UX designs. |
| **Developer**          | Mike Ramirez       | Develop frontend, backend, and APIs.     |
| **QA Tester**          | Chloe Nguyen       | Execute test cases and validate features.|

---

### 4. **Built Core Templates**
We created foundational templates for the project:
1. **Business_Overview.md**: High-level overview of the business goals, challenges, and solutions.
2. **Process_Documentation.md**: Outlined the project workflow, tools, and team responsibilities.
3. **Test_Cases.md**: Listed structured test cases for core features.
4. **Testing_Report.md**: Summarized test execution results, bugs, and recommendations.

Each template included:
- A clear purpose.
- Structured sections for organized content.
- Actionable AI Agent Prompts for validation and refinement.

---

### 5. **Structured the Project Directory**
We created a well-defined project directory with descriptions for each file and folder:

```

```

### 6. **AI Agent Prompts**
We created AI Agent Prompts for every document to:
- Validate content completeness.
- Identify missing elements.
- Suggest improvements and next steps.

Example:
> "Review the Business Overview document to ensure the goals align with the project scope. Highlight any missing details."

---

## Lessons Learned
1. Starting with structured questions helps clarify scope and requirements.
2. Breaking the workflow into phases and templates simplifies execution.
3. Using simulated team roles improves clarity on responsibilities.
4. AI Agent Prompts accelerate validation and refinements.

---

## Next Steps
1. Continue filling out any remaining documents.
2. Start work on **README.md** to tie the project together.
3. Prepare next steps for design and feature prioritization.
