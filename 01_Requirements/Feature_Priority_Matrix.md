## Purpose
The Feature Prioritization Matrix helps identify and prioritize features for the Skee-Ball League Management Application. It ensures a focus on high-value features that align with stakeholder needs while balancing development effort and project constraints.

---

## Prioritization Framework
Features are evaluated based on:
1. **Business Value**: How important is this feature to achieving the goals of the app?
2. **User Impact**: How critical is the feature for user satisfaction and adoption?
3. **Development Effort**: How complex is the feature to implement?
4. **Urgency**: How soon is the feature needed (e.g., MVP vs. future releases)?

Each feature is scored on a scale of **1â€“5**:
- 1: Low priority/value/impact
- 5: High priority/value/impact

The final priority is determined based on combined scores.

## Notes on Prioritization
- **MVP Features**: Core functionality required to launch the app successfully (manual score input, standings calculation, team/player management, leaderboards, match scheduling).
- **Phase 2 Features**: Enhancements that improve user experience but are not essential for MVP (notifications, player logins, exports, mobile responsiveness).
- **Future Features**: Advanced features that can be implemented post-MVP based on feedback and demand (visual analytics, additional reporting).

## AI Agent Prompt for Next Steps
**Prompt**:
"I have created a Feature Prioritization Matrix for the Skee-Ball League Management Application. The matrix includes features prioritized based on business value, user impact, development effort, and urgency. Below is the full content:

<Insert Feature Prioritization Matrix Here>

Using this document, please:
1. Validate if the prioritization aligns with best practices for MVP development.
2. Identify any missing features that might be critical for the MVP release.
3. Provide a step-by-step plan for breaking down MVP features into actionable development tasks, assuming I am learning and require clear, simplified guidance."
